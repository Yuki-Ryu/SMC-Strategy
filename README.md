# SMC-Strategy
(SMC) Multi-Timeframe Strategy Smart Money Concept is not a single indicator but a framework for understanding market structure and the behavior of large, influential players (banks, hedge funds, institutional investors).

The core elements are:

Market Structure Shift (MSS): Identifying the transition from a bullish to bearish structure (or vice versa). This is the foundation. A "Break of Structure" (BOS) confirms the trend, while a "Change of Character" (CHoCH) signals a potential reversal. Smart Money trades in the direction of the new structure.

Order Blocks (OBs): These are the "footprints" of smart money. They are zones on the chart where significant buy or sell orders were previously placed, causing a strong, impulsive price move. Once price returns to these zones, it's expected that latent orders remain, making them high-probability areas for the next major move.

Liquidity Pools: Smart money does not buy at the bottom or sell at the top; they trade against retail sentiment. They hunt for liquidityâ€”clusters of stop-loss orders above old highs (known as "buys stops") or below old lows ("sell stops"). Engineering moves to take out these stops provides them with the fuel and favorable prices for their own larger positions.

Breaker & Mitigation Blocks: Specific types of order blocks that act as defense lines. A Mitigation Block is a zone that must hold to keep a trend intact. A Breaker Block is a zone that, if reclaimed, effectively "breaks" the current trend and signals a reversal, often catching the market offside.

Fair Value Gaps (FVG) / Imbalances: These are inefficiencies or "gaps" in the market created by a strong, impulsive move. Price often returns to these gaps to "fill" the imbalance, providing entry opportunities in the direction of the original trend.

In essence: The SMC is a game of anticipation. The expert uses these elements to read the narrative of the market: where Smart Money is likely placing its orders (Order Blocks), where it's running stops to get better prices (Liquidity Pools), and what the key levels are that confirm their intent (Market Structure). It's about trading with the institutions, not against them.
